## Overview

This plugin for [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) creates an archive with [JBoss modules](https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/MODULES/Home) to be installed to a [JBoss 7](https://www.jboss.org/jbossas) server installation.

Crafting the modules by hand is more cumbersome than to define a recipe that allows to construct the modules folder with all dependencies already defined by a [Maven POM](http://maven.apache.org/pom.html).
